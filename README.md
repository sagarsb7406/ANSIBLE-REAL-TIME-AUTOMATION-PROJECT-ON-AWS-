🚀 Excited to share my recent progress on the Ansible Real-Time Automation Project on AWS! 🎉

I had the opportunity to dive deeper into automation with Ansible, focusing on orchestrating EC2 instances on AWS. Here’s a quick breakdown of the tasks:

✅ Task 1: Created three EC2 instances on AWS using Ansible loops:

Two Ubuntu instances 🐧
One Linux instance 🐱
Configured with connection: local on the Ansible control node.

✅ Task 2: Set up seamless, passwordless SSH authentication between the Ansible control node and each instance for secure and easy access.


✅ Task 3: Automated the shutdown of Ubuntu instances only by using Ansible conditionals, based on gathered facts.

This project has been a great hands-on experience with real-time automation and AWS provisioning. I’m excited to continue building on these skills and exploring new automation challenges! 💡
